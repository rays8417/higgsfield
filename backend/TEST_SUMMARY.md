## Test Architecture

### **Mocking Strategy**
- **Comprehensive Prisma Mocking**: All database operations are mocked
- **Isolated Testing**: No real database dependencies
- **Fast Execution**: Tests run in milliseconds
- **Reliable**: Consistent results across environments

### **Test Structure**
```
src/__tests__/
├── setup.ts              # Global test setup and Prisma mocking
└── routes/
    ├── admin.test.ts      # Admin route tests (26 tests)
    ├── rewards.test.ts    # Rewards route tests (20 tests)
    ├── scoring.test.ts    # Scoring route tests (16 tests)

    ├── tournaments.test.ts # Tournaments route tests (16 tests)
    └── users.test.ts      # Users route tests (16 tests)
```

### **Test Categories**
Each route is tested for:
- ✅ **Success Scenarios** - Valid requests with proper responses
- ✅ **Validation Errors** - Missing fields, invalid data, business rule violations
- ✅ **Database Errors** - Error handling and proper error responses
- ✅ **Edge Cases** - Null values, empty results, pagination limits
- ✅ **Business Logic** - Complex rules like credit limits, tournament constraints

## Key Features

### **Realistic Test Data**
- Mock data matches actual Prisma schema structure
- Proper enum values for status fields
- Realistic relationships between entities
- Proper date formatting and data types

### **Comprehensive Error Testing**
- Database connection failures
- Invalid input validation
- Business rule violations
- Edge case scenarios

### **Business Logic Validation**
- Tournament status constraints
- Credit limit enforcement
- Captain/vice-captain requirements
- Participant counting
- Score calculations with multipliers

### **API Response Validation**
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error message consistency
- Data structure validation
